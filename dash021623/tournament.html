<br /><br />
The one-day tournament and the qualifying races will use Version 8 of the DASH Randomizer logic. Information about Version 8 of the DASH Randomizer, as well as the program to generate seeds, can be found here: <a href="index.html">https://dashrando.github.io</a>

GENERAL INFORMATION
<br />
<ul>
   <li>This one-day tournament will feature a 16-player single-elimination bracket.</li>
   <li>Players who win their match will move on to the next round while the players who lose will be immediately knocked out of the tournament.</li>
   <li>The seeding for this tournament will be based on the qualifying races. Further details will be listed in the "Qualifying Information" section below.</li>
   <li>The tournament races and qualifying races will be done using SRL. In the unlikely scenario where both players in a tournament race tie with the same official SRL time, the player with the higher seed will be declared the winner and will move on to the next round of the tournament.</li>
   <li>Palette swaps and custom sprites will be allowed for this tournament, but only after approval by an organizer. There will be further specific rules on this subject that will be covered in the DASH Tournament Discord server in advance of the event. Invites to the server will be sent to qualifying players shortly after each qualifying race (more information below).</li>
   <li>There will be a $250 total prize pool for this tournament provided directly by the organizers:
      <ul>
         <li>1st Place - $100</li>
         <li>2nd Place - $60</li>
         <li>3rd and 4th Place - $25 each</li>
         <li>5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Place - $10 each</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Before the tournament officially concludes, there will be a Crowd Control race of a DASH Randomizer seed. A portion of the proceeds from this race will go towards increasing the prize pool of the Super Metroid Randomizer Tournament at SG Live 2020! Kipp donated $210 to get the tournament established, but further donations throughout the year will help Super Metroid get more attention at SG Live 2020.

PARTICIPANT EXPECTATIONS
<br />
<ul>
   <li>Players who qualify are expected to block off the full day of January 18, 2020 on their calendars and be on standby to race at any time until they are knocked out of the tournament or win the championship. We will have a few breaks throughout the day for people to be able to eat and rest, as well as plan in advance so that players never have to race immediately back to back, but in general we need the participants ready to race throughout the day without delay. </li>
   <li>Half of the first round matches (4/8) will be restreamed on one of the SpeedGaming channels. After that, all quarterfinals (4), semifinals (2), and finals (1) matches will be restreamed with small breaks in between. Therefore, it is mandatory that participants be available and ready to race as the schedule fluctuates. <u>Further information on the tournament schedule can be found in the "Tournament Schedule" section below</u>. </li>
   <li>A rough schedule of the specific races and restreams will be released to the participants in advance of the day of the tournament. This will help participants with planning on the day of the tournament for meals, breaks, etc. </li>
   <li><u>If you do not feel as though you can dedicate the entire day to be available to race in the tournament on January 18, 2020, please do not participate in the qualifiers. It is very important that we have 16 committed players on that day to avoid any forfeiting.</u></li>

QUALIFYING INFORMATION
<br />
<ul>
   <li>To qualify for a spot in the 16-player tournament, a player will need to be 1 of the top 4 finishers (designated as the 4 players with the fastest finishing race times) in 1 of the 4 qualifying races that will occur on the dates and times listed above. This can only be adjusted by the tie rules, which can be found in a bullet below. </li>
   <li>Players who qualify are still invited to race in subsequent qualifying races. In this case, the top 4 finishers who have not previously qualified for the tournament will be the 4 players earning a qualifying spot during each qualifying race.</li>
   <li>Seeding will be based on each qualifying player's individual best time in the 4 qualifying races, so participation in all 4 qualifying races is encouraged, but not mandatory.</li>
   <li>The qualifying races will be done using SRL. The SRL race channel will be announced in the SRL Super Metroid Discord prior to each qualifying race. Anyone is welcome to participate.</li>
   <li>In the unlikely scenario where multiple players in a qualifying race tie for the 4th qualifying spot with the same official SRL time, the following set of rules will be used:
      <ul>
         <li>If this occurs during qualifying race 1, 2, or 3, all players will qualify for the tournament and race 4 will have its total number of potential qualifying spots reduced to the appropriate amount to reach 16 qualifying players.</li>
         <li>If there are ties in multiple races, the adjustment to race 4 will still be in affect. Each race must have at least 1 spot guaranteed to qualify for the tournament.</li>
         <li>The organizers reserve the right to also adjust the number of qualifying spots in race 3 to accommodate for multiple ties in races 1 and 2. </li>
         <li>If any foul play is suspected in terms of purposeful ties, the organizers reserve the right to void the suspected players' times and bar them from participating in the tournament. </li>
         <li>If multiple players in race 4 tie for the final qualifying spot in the tournament, then the organizers will set up an individual play-in race for those specific players. This race may or may not be restreamed.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>The players featured on the restream of each qualifying race will be selected at the discretion of the organizers. Once a player has qualified, he or she will be less likely to be featured on a restream as it is preferred to have players who have not yet qualified featured on the restream.</li>
   <li>All players participating in a qualifying race must stream their run and have the vod available for potential review by the organizers for at least 1 week after the race. Failure to comply with this rule could lead to the loss of an earned qualifying spot in the tournament. </li>
   <li>Once a player has qualified, the organizers will attempt to reach out to that player on Discord to confirm his or her participation in the tournament. If a player is unable to be communicated with or does not respond within one day of qualifying, another player will be used instead.</li>
   <li>All qualifying players must join the DASH Tournament Discord server for ease of communication leading up to and during the tournament. Again, invites to the server will be sent to qualifying players shortly after each qualifying race.</li>
   <li>After all 16 qualifying players have confirmed their participation, a Challonge bracket will be set up for the tournament. </li>
   <li>The organizers reserves the right to have the final say on all players who participate. If any suspected cheating or other negative situations arise at any point during the qualifying process or during the tournament, the organizers will handle it as they see fit. If a player is not comfortable with this, then he or she should not participate. </li>
