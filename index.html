        Here is my low-tech front page for the Super Metroid romhacks I've worked on, most recent first. <br>
        - My goal with hack randomizers is to preserve the original behavior of the hack as much as possible <br>
        <br>
        STARDUST <br>
        <a href="https://randorandy.github.io/stardustRando/">https://randorandy.github.io/stardustRando/</a> <br>
        - With the BT-locked door, Morph and Bombs will always be in the early area. <br>
        - The final Tourian E-Tank is unaltered, as well as the first two items in the escape. <br>
         <br>
        RECOVERY <br>
        <a href="https://randorandy.github.io/recoveryRando/">https://randorandy.github.io/recoveryRando/</a> <br>
        - There are no softlock protections for certain items. Consider how you will get out of Wave Beam, LN, etc. <br>
         <br>
        ESCAPE 2, 1.9 <br>
        <a href="https://randorandy.github.io/Escape2Rando/">https://randorandy.github.io/Escape2Rando/</a> <br>
        - The Secret Spore Spawn door to backdoor Tourian takes you to G4 statues instead, meaning G4 bosses are required. <br>
        - Early Supers usually means to go to the Wrecked Ship Warp Zone, then Brinstar for more progression. <br>
         <br>
        ERIS 2012 <br>
        <a href="https://randorandy.github.io/ErisRando/">https://randorandy.github.io/ErisRando/</a> <br>
        - Artifacts and their locations are shuffled into the item pool. Find 4 of them and go win! <br>
        - The "101 Missile" in the ceiling is also in the randomized pool, obtainable with Ice Beam. <br>
         <br>
        CRYOGENESIS 1.0 <br>
        <a href="https://randorandy.github.io/cryogenesis-rando/">https://randorandy.github.io/cryogenesis-rando/</a> <br>
        - Added Plasma and Speed Booster to this romhack. Speed blocks will break with Speed or Meteorite. <br>
        - You will need the Meteorite to logically exit the Meteorite area. Do not enter without it. <br>
         <br>
        SUBVERSION 1.2 * Note, buxnq has updated and maintained this since December 2022 * <br>
        <a href="https://subversionrando.github.io/SubversionRando/">https://subversionrando.github.io/SubversionRando/</a> <br>
         - Subversion has several options for logic, area rando, and other new features. <br>
